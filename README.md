Platform: Ali Cloud</br>
System: CentOS release 6.5 (Final)</br>
Script: Shell & Python3</br>

This scenario is sending alarms to yourself. Because the script needs to login Web WeChat and the message sent to yourself will be marked as MarkRead. Therefore, phone WeChat won't remind you for the new message. So I used the Wechat Official Account to send to message to myself.
